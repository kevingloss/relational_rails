# Relational Rails



## Turing 2110 Back End Module 2: [Relational Rails Project](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/projects/relational_rails)

### About:
 - Welcome to Relational Rails. This project is an intro to Ruby on Rails and the one to many relationship of databases. It features the basics of CRUD and RESTful routing to follow proper conventions. There are basic ActiveRecord associations and usability to navigate the app and perform basic sort/filter functionality. See the below schema that was used with our project.

### Built With:
 - This repository requires and has been tested on Ruby v2.7.2 and is based on Rails 5.2.6.
 - RSpec, Pry, SimpleCov, Capybara, Launchy, Shoulda-Matchers v5.0, and Orderly have been installed and setup.

### Setup:
 1. Fork this Repo
 2. Clone your Fork
 3. In your terminal run the following:
 4. `git clone <paste_repo>`
 5. `cd <repo_name>`
 6. `bundle install`
 7. `rails db:{create, migrate, seed}`

### Testing:
 - If you'd like to run through the test suite just use the rspec spec/<file_name> on any of the spec files.
 - SimpleCov is also used to ensure tests have full coverage.
  - To run the Simplecov report type the following into your terminal: open coverage/index.html
  - See details here: [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)
  - There are both unit and integration tests for the individual methods and for methods that incorporate several others.

### Challenges & Wins:
 - This project was great to get accustomed to MVC, Restful Routes, CRUD, ActiveRecord Associations, basic rails helpers such as `form_with`, and overall experience with schema and databases.
 - Learning how to incoporate GitHub and the PR's in a different manner with the more complex structure.
